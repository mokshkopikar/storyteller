# 📚 Interactive Storytelling & Assessment App for 8th Grade Students

## Overview

This project is an interactive storytelling and assessment app designed specifically for 8th grade students. The app guides students through creative story experiences and evaluates their reading and writing skills using standards based on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) English Language Arts Item and Scoring Sampler.

## 👩‍🏫 How It Works

### 🌟 Starting the Experience
- The app begins its conversation when the user says “Hi” or any similar greeting.
- It will then ask the student what kind of story they would like to read.

### ✍️ Interactive Storytelling
- Based on the student's response, the app will generate the first paragraph of a short, three-paragraph story.
- After the first paragraph, the app will ask the student if they want to continue the story in a different direction.
- This continues until all three paragraphs are written or the student opts to move to the assessment section.

### 🧠 Student Assessment
Once the story is complete or the student chooses to move into assessment, the app will evaluate their reading and writing skills through the following:

1. **Multiple-Choice (MC) Question**
   - One question with four answer choices.
   - Scored 0 or 1.

2. **Evidence-Based Selected-Response (EBR) Question**
   - One question with four answer choices, requiring evidence selection.
   - Scored 0 or 1.

3. **Text-Dependent Analysis (TDA) Prompt**
   - One short essay prompt.
   - Scored from 1 to 4 using the official PSSA scoring rubric.

### 📋 Assessment Standards

All questions and scoring are based on the **"Pennsylvania System of School Assessment English Language Arts Item and Scoring Sampler"**.  
This includes:
- **Multiple-Choice Items**
- **Evidence-Based Selected-Response Items**
- **Text-Dependent Analysis Prompts**

The app also references **solved examples** from the document to:
- Maintain appropriate reading complexity for 8th graders.
- Accurately grade student responses using PSSA rubrics and examples.

### 🧾 Feedback

After the student completes all assessment questions, the app will:
- Display the score for each item (MC, EBR, and TDA).
- Provide clear, detailed, and actionable feedback for improvement.
- Ask the student whether they would like to begin another story.

### 🛑 Exiting the App

If the student types **"stop"** at any point or chooses not to continue, the app will:
- Thank them for participating.
- Prompt them to complete this survey:

### 🚫 Handling Inappropriate Input

If the student enters something inappropriate or off-topic, the app will:
- Politely inform the student that the input was not appropriate.
- Encourage the student to respond appropriately to continue the activity.

## 🧠 Developer Notes

- Ensure the PSSA ELA Sampler is reviewed thoroughly, especially:
  - The **scoring guidelines** for MC, EBR, and TDA sections.
  - The **solved examples** and their corresponding rubrics.
- All story paragraphs should align with the complexity and themes suitable for 8th graders as seen in the sampler.

## ✅ Goals

- Make learning fun and interactive through personalized storytelling.
- Provide effective, standards-aligned reading and writing assessments.
- Offer meaningful feedback to support literacy development.
